# Clean-to-Green
Overview:
This project is the result of our team's effort in creating community websites aimed at enhancing user engagement and providing real-time data using various technologies including React, SQL, DynamoDB, and the City of Calgary Maps API.

## Features:
### React for Intuitive UI: 
We utilized React to build an intuitive user interface, ensuring seamless navigation and enhanced user experience.
### SQL for Data Management: 
SQL was employed for efficient data management, enabling us to handle and manipulate data effectively.
### DynamoDB for Scalability: 
Leveraging DynamoDB allowed us to ensure scalability, enabling the system to handle increased loads without compromising performance. This contributed significantly to reducing page load time to an impressive 5ms loading time.
### Integration of City of Calgary Maps API: 
We seamlessly integrated the City of Calgary Maps API to provide real-time data to users. This integration enabled us to track over 60 neighborhoods using live data, offering users up-to-date information.
